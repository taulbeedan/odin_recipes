This recipe website is a demonstration of the skills I have learned in using HTML.
I will create directories for my pages and images. 
I will enter the HTML boilerplate on each page I write.
I will use headers, paragraphs, italics, and bold text.
I will include links, both absolute and relative, and I will include images.
I will stage my finished project in git, and then I will push it to origin main.
